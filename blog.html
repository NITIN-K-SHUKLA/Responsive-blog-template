        <p>In today's world, we are all heavily reliant on various software products that were carefully programmed by
            developers. But what is computer programming?</p>
        <p> In this article, I will provide a definition of programming, as well as examples of different types of
            programmers. I will also suggest a list of courses you can take to start learning how to code.</p>
        <h2>Definiton of Programming</h2>
        <p>A computer program consists of code that is executed on a computer to perform particular tasks. This code is
            written by programmers.

            Programming is the process of giving machines a set of instructions that describe how a program should be
            carried out. Programmers will spend their whole careers learning a variety of programming languages and
            tools so they can effectively build computer programs.

            Programmers will start by using a code editor or IDE to write what is called source code. This is a
            collection of code written in a programming language that other programmers can read.

            Source code needs to be converted into machine language so machines can understand the instructions and
            execute the program. This process of converting source code into machine language is known as compiling.

            Examples of compiled programming languages would be C and C++.

            There are other languages that do not use compilers. Instead, these languages will use an interpreter that
            will read and execute the code.

            Examples of interpreted programming languages would be JavaScript and PHP.

            Once the code is executed, then the computer program can run. The different types of computer programs
            include Word processors, Database systems, video games, and websites.

            These computer programs allow us to interactive with different software devices and services like phones,
            websites, and the computers themselves.</p>
        <h2>History of Programming</h2>
        <p>Many historians believe Ada Lovelace was the first to create a published computer program in the mid 19th
            century. She was a mathematician who translated Luigi Federico Menabrea's writings on the Analytical Engine.

            In this translation, Ada had added her own extensive notes and created a method for calculating Bernoulli
            numbers for the Analytical Engine.

            The work of mathematician Alonzo Church as well as the Turing machine were the first introductions of
            computer codes.

            In the 1920's, computers were created which was followed by the earliest programming languages. For the next
            century, as machines and technology continued to evolve, so did the number of programming languages.</p>
        <h2>Types of programming languages</h2>
        <p>There are hundreds of programming languages in existence. Developers will first consider the needs of the
            application so they can decide which languages would be appropriate to use.</p>
        <p>Here are a few popular programming languages. </p>
        <ol type="i">
            <li>C++</li>
            <li>Java</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>Ruby</li>
            <li>Kotlin</li>
            <li>C#</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Some of these languages are primarily used in one field of development while others are more general purpose
            programming languages.

            JavaScript is primarily used in web development and is usually the first programming language learned by
            beginner web developers. JavaScript can also be used for mobile and game development.

            Python can be used in a variety of areas like data analysis, machine learning, and web development.</p>
